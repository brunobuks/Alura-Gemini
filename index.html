                    <p>
                        The simple answer
                        When you enter a prompt into Gemini, it replies with a response using the information it already knows or fetches from other sources, like other Google services.

                <h2>What is Generative AI?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Generative AI is a type of machine learning model. Generative AI is not a human being. It can't think for itself or feel emotions. It's just great at finding patterns.

                <h2>Why can Gemini get things wrong?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Generative AI and all of its possibilities are exciting, but it's still new. Gemini will make mistakes. Even though it's getting better every day, Gemini can provide inaccurate information, or it can even make offensive statements.

                <h2>Double-check information you get from Gemini</h2>
                    <p>
                        Gemini has tools to help you identify potentially inaccurate statements. One way to double-check Gemini's responses is to use the Google button. This uses Google Search to find content that helps you assess and further research the information you get from Gemini.

                <h2>Is Gemini able to explain how it works?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Gemini can hallucinate and present inaccurate information as factual. One example is that Gemini often misrepresents how it works. We've seen this occur in a number of instancesâ€”for example, in response to prompts asking how it was trained or how it carries out various functions (like citing sources, or providing fresh information).

                <h2>Can Gemini help with coding?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Yes, Gemini can help with coding and topics about coding, but you are responsible for your use of code or coding explanations. So you should use discretion and carefully test and review all code for errors, bugs, and vulnerabilities before relying on it. Code may also be subject to an open source license and Gemini provides related information.

                <h2>Why doesn't Gemini know what I said earlier in a conversation?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Gemini's ability to hold context is purposefully limited for now. As Gemini continues to learn, its ability to hold context during longer conversations will improve.

                <h2>What are Google's principles for AI innovation?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Google aspires to create technologies that solve important problems and help people in their daily lives. We are optimistic about the incredible potential for AI and other advanced technologies to empower people, widely benefit current and future generations, and work for the common good. We believe that these technologies will promote innovation and further our mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.

                        One important part of developing responsibly is expanding participation, so more people can experience Gemini, provide feedback, and help Gemini improve. You can rate responses as good or bad and send feedback each time Gemini responds.
